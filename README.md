hrva-wiki-walking-tour
======================

### [Demo](http://tonyfinnis.github.io/hrva-wiki-walking-tour/)

Web based walking tour app that uses localwiki API for data

1. Create a walking tour of your neighborhood that consists of a number of specific places to visit, or use an existing walking tour like Olde Towne Portsmouth's Path of History (see the example below) or one of [Norfolk's Tours](http://www.visitnorfolktoday.com/things-to-do/tour/self-guided) like the Cannonball Trail.
2. Create a page in HRVA Wiki for each stop on the tour. For exmaple, one of the stops on the Path of History walking tour is the [1846 Courthouse](http://localwiki.net/hrva/1846_Courthouse).
3. Tag the each page with the `walking tour` tag and a tag for your specific tour (e.g. `path of history`).
4. Create a map for the page that specifies exactly where that stop on the walking tour is.
5. Fork this repo and change the Wiki API links to grab your tags.
